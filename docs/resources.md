### Git troubleshooting

If you ever want to see what's happening under the covers with Git, you're likely to want one or more of the following environment variables:
- [`GIT_TRACE2=1`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/a-deep-dive-into-git-performance-using-trace2/) for deep tracing
  - `GIT_TRACE2_PERF` offers a nice, table-oriented format which is easy to read
- [`GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables#_networking) for network operations
- [`GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables#_debugging) for packet-level tracing
- [`GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -vvv"`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-coresshCommand) for SSH tracing (you can use 1, 2, or 3 `v`s depending on how verbose you want the output)
